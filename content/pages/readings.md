Some of the readings refer to the optional (but recommended) course textbook: Dodd, Annabel, _The Essential Guide to Telecommunications_, 3rd ed. This text introduces technologies relevant to the telecommunications marketplace, and is strongly recommended for students that are new to the industry.

Other texts will be kept on reserve at the library are:

*   _Newton's Telecom Dictionary_ by Harry Newton and Ray Horak is an industry classic that helps readers understand many technologies and acronymns.
*   Steve Rosenbush from _USA Today_ published _Telecom Business Opportunities_ which contains many interesting anecdotes about firms in their early years.
